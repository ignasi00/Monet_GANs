“Every artist dips his brush in his own soul, and paints his own nature into his pictures” - Henry Ward Beecher

## Structure

- data_lists: lists which contain the pathes of the images we will use. This directory will be empty, because the lists will be personal of each member (each member will have his own file structure). In root directory it will be an script to generate lists (to genereate each member lists).
- datasets: dataset objects will be defined. It will contain the lists that will be loadeded by the datasets.
  - wrappingdatasets: scripts to transformate all data included in a dataset.
